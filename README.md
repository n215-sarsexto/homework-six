Yet again a continuation of the travel-fly project, the main purpose this time around was to work on mix-ins. They are a very handy tool, which act sort of like php for css. I found myself restructuring a tiny bit of the webstie in order to best make use of these, and it made creating all of the tour pages much, much easier. I haven't yet figured out how I want to include all of the tour pages in the navigation, but for now, they are navigable from various buttons around the website. This continued to challenge my mobile responsive thinking in considering exactly how I want to set things up for mobile, and I truly feel it is at the point where it is becoming easier. Enjoy!
